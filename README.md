This is a project for friends and classmates to use in order to help them with their Spanish Schoolwork/homework. It is a website that generates
the current spanish words (from class) in a random order to be copied and pasted into a text editor on their device, or other websites.

This website is not affiliated or approved by San Jose Unified School District or Gunderson High School.

Intended use:
1. My website is used to study **before** a test. 
2. When visiting the site, click the Randomize! button to randomly sort the current words in a random order.
3. Copy the list of words onto a text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Google Doc, etc.) and write down the definitions of the words next to them.
4. Try to see if you can memorize their definitions.

I manually update this website when new vocabulary words are released. This means the Vocabulary Words will need some time to update.
I rely completely on third party sources for the spanish words.

I cannot guarantee that this website will always be available. Please do not rely on this website to study, or please have backup plans.

I really did just copy and paste everything from my English vocab helper to this one.
